## ARCHITECTURE OF PROJECT

The architecture of our project, Revvup Market, is built upon a foundation of collaborative effort and expertise 
from our team members. Led by Juris Alson, our group leader, we have crafted a dynamic and visually appealing platform
aimed at attracting users and providing them with a seamless experience.

Juris Alson spearheaded the conceptualization and design aspects of the project, laying down the framework for its
aesthetic appeal and overall organization. Ericson Cruz contributed significantly to the project by implementing
responsive design principles and handling its backend development, ensuring that our platform is accessible across
various devices.

Jerard Macandog played a crucial role in bringing visionary design elements to the project, adding depth and creativity
to our interface. Nicklaus Rosales brought his expertise in API integration and user interaction, enhancing the functionality
and usability of Revvup Market.

Finally, Neoron Lopez contributed his skills in backend development and design, adding the finishing touches to our project and
ensuring that it meets both aesthetic and functional requirements.

Together, our team successfully launched Revvup Market, a platform that combines sleek design, seamless functionality, and
engaging user experience to meet the needs of our audience.

## Configuration Steps:

Initialization:
Begin by launching VS Code and initializing a Git repository for your project. Open the integrated terminal within VS Code and
execute the command git init to initialize a Git repository in your project directory.

Linking Local Repository to Remote Repository:
Next, link your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. In your terminal, use the command git remote add origin
<GitHub repository URL>, replacing <GitHub repository URL> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this
URL on your GitHub repository's homepage or when cloning the repository.

Cloning Remote Repository:
If you're working with an existing remote repository, you can clone it into your desired local directory. Use the
command git clone <GitHub repository URL> in your terminal to clone the repository. This action creates a local
copy of the remote repository, enabling you to work on it locally.

Making Changes:
With the local repository set up, you can now modify and add code to your project as needed.

Using Git Features in VS Code:

Once the initial setup is complete, you can leverage VS Code's built-in Git features to manage
your project efficiently:

Staging Changes:
Utilize the Source Control view in VS Code to stage specific files or changes you wish to commit.
This allows you to organize your changes before committing them.

Committing Changes:
After staging your changes, add a descriptive commit message detailing the modifications. Commit your staged
changes to record them in the repository's history.

Pushing Changes:
Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the Push functionality within the Source
Control view. This action synchronizes your local changes with the remote repository, making them accessible
to collaborators and ensuring version control
